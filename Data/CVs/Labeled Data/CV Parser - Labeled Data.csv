236.pdf,This thesis discusses the development of a pulsed power system for high power picosecond,I-W
236.pdf,"pulse radiation. In the system, a charging transformer, which generates a high voltage pulse of ~100",I-W
236.pdf,"kV, can be used for charging a transmission line in less than 100 ns. Such a short pulse could cause",I-W
236.pdf,a peak gap switch to break down and generate a picosecond pulse transient for radiation. A,I-W
236.pdf,"dielectric antenna, if fed with the high voltage picosecond pulses, can radiate them to targets made",I-W
236.pdf,"of high dielectric materials. Biological tissues, for instance, can be targeted for electrostimulation.",I-W
236.pdf,The transformer was designed considering the needs to deliver a high gain and fast output.,I-W
236.pdf,"We showed that a transformer in the dual resonant mode, in which the resonance of the primary and",I-W
236.pdf,"the second is equal, can produce a voltage gain of approximately 6. The output voltage of the",I-W
236.pdf,transformer is more than 100kV with an input of 15kV. This shows the average gain of the,I-W
236.pdf,transformer is 7. The fast output requires the voltage at the secondary winding needs to be less than,I-W
236.pdf,100 ns in order for achieving a picosecond transient in the oil peak switch. This was done by low-,I-W
236.pdf,inductance windings with an air core. Two winding configurations were explored: a cylindrical,I-W
236.pdf,winding and a toroidal winding. The cylindrical winding appears to be a better option in terms of,I-W
236.pdf,"the gain. Experimental results show that for a capacitive load (30pF), the voltage can be charged up",I-W
236.pdf,to 33 kV in 20 ns.,I-W
236.pdf,A conical dielectric antenna was investigated through simulation and experiments. The,I-W
236.pdf,antenna is made of a V-shape transmission line on a ceramic conical body with dielectric constant,I-W
236.pdf,"of 28. This antenna was immersed in transformer oil for high voltage insulation, which allowed for",I-W
236.pdf,the feed voltage to be as high as 50 kV. The antenna was characterized by an electric field sensor,I-W
236.pdf,"immersed in water. We found that the emitted field increases as the voltage increases, but it reaches",I-W
236.pdf,a saturation for 40 kV. The highest electric field is 1.5 kV/cm even for the input voltage 50 kV. This,I-W
236.pdf,is 6 times less than simulation. We speculate that the discrepancy is caused by the dielectric tangent,I-W
236.pdf,"loss, which was not taken into account in the simulation.",I-W
