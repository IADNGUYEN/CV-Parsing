Project
12/06/2017 –
24/07/2017
Fingerprint Recognition.
○ Description: My team built an algorithm for fingerprint recognition and a module for
validation. We built it on Matlab.
○ Result: The accuracy was over 90 percent.
11/11/2017 –
06/12/2017
Fire Detection.
○ Description: I built an algorithm for fire detection on Raspberry Pi 3 with a camrera USB.
I used Python and opencv library to build it.
○ Result: The accuracy was 85 percent.
19/01/2017 –
09/02/2017
Face Detection and Recognition.
○ Description: I built an algorithm for face detection and recognition by using Haar feature.
Then, i trained feature.
○ Result: The accuracy was over 90 percent for detection, 80 percent for recognition.
