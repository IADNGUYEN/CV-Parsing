o Two years practice in the laboratory.
3/2018-4/2018
o Project 1: Device control via Bluetooth.
o Project 2: Design Led Matrix Clock.
o Graduation thesis: Nonlinear system control using intelligent algorithms.  Inside, Intelligent algorithms are Fuzzy logic and neural network. Nonlinear systems are TRMS
and AC motor speed control model. The TRMS is a laboratory platform designed for control
experiments by Feedback Instruments. In certain aspects, its behavior resembles that of a
helicopter. My programming software is Matlab Simulink and microcontroller use is STM32F4.
Beside Matlab Simulink also have the task is to monitor the operation of the system. The main
purpose of the topic is to build algorithms and controllers in actual testing and showed to verify the
effectiveness and applicability of intelligent algorithms.
o “Deal with uncertainty systems using intelligent control methods”, Journal of Technical 
Education Science, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education.
o Award Autonomous Vehicle Contest 2017 THIRD PLACE
o University scholarships for the semester: 5,6,7.
