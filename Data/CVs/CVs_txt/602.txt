RELEVANT PROJECTS 
PROJECTS 
TECHNOLOGIES 
In-memory data recovery (LAZADA) 
(2015) 
Project aims to recover data in memory in case the 
server’s down and up. We combine the share memory 
technique and memcached, an open source allows to 
take memory from different parts of system and make 
it accessible to areas where you have less than you 
need. 
Duties: 
Design new data structures in order to 
move cached data from heap to shared 
memory. And then restore and  
reconstruct the cached data from shared 
memory when server’s down and up 
C/C++ 
Share memory and memcached 
technique 
Implement the new data structures to 
store memcached data in share memory 
Traffic Generation for VOIP system (TMA) 
(2/2012 – 2015) 
A number of tools, that simulate the clients, gateways, 
gateway controller, call processing server using 
various of telecom protocols (SIP, H.248, MGCP,...), 
are used to test many components in VOIP system of 
Nortel in the past, and now Genband. 
Duties: 
Be responsible for technical leader. 
Add new features and fix bugs in the system. 
Troubleshoot problems in system verification 
labs. 
C/C++, Java 
Socket, Multi-threading 
SIP, H.248, MGCP, STB 
HTTP/HTTPS 
Perl/Python scripts. 
Core and GWC patching (TMA) 
(1/2011 – 2/2012) 
Nortel in the past and now Genband solution for 
telecom system which combines the advantage of 
VoIP and the traditional TDM network:  
Converged networks are managed IP 
core networks that can simultaneously 
support real-time IP telephony, 
multimedia and a range of data services 
Uniquely placed to enable network 
operators to adopt the new packet-based 
network architecture without having to 
restrict themselves 
Includes call processing agents, 
translations, routing, billing and services 
software 
Duties: 
Implement the propagation patch from the 
original patch for CORE and GWC 
C/C++, Protel 
VoIP (SIP, H.248…) 
Proprietary technologies 
Perl/Python scripts. 
Building an  Anti-virus and Anti-spam system 
for emails using grid technology (HCMUS) 
(2009 – 2010) 
Base on Globus Toolkits and some email support 
tool, building a system that stores safe emails on 
wide network. When the system receives user 
emails, it will determine a suitable resource to 
scan emails for spam or virus, then store them 
Duties: 
Design and implement whole system 
Java 
Qmail, ClamAV, SpamAssassin 
Globus Toolkits 
Building a distributed storage system using 
grid technology (HCMUS) 
(2007 – 2008) 
Base on Storage Resource Broker tool, building a 
system managing distributed data on wide network. 
When users upload data to system, system will 
determine a suitable resource to store data. The 
system allows users to store and access data via web 
interface. 
JAVA, JSP  
PostgreSQL 
HTML, CSS 
Storage Resource Broker, 
Network Weather Service 
Duties: 
Design and implement whole system
