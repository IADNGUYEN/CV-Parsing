ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE 
Mechanical Engineer at Leonard Lab | Princeton University 
June 2018 – August 2018 
Set up an experiment consisting of a VICON system, Spotlights, and KOBUKI TurtleBots integrated under ROS (Robot OS) 
Wrote code to solve first-order differential equations by compiling data from the aforementioned systems via sensors and VICON 
cameras, and rerouting the results to the TurtleBots in real time 
International CanSat Competition 2018 
Part of a team which worked on designing and constructing an Aero-Braking Atmospheric Entry Probe 
Designed, modeled (via CAD), 3D printed, and assembled the body of the probe based on differential equations for the drag 
experienced by a body in a uniform hypersonic flow 
Designed, implemented and tested the parachute release mechanism for the probe 
7th Annual Brown IEEE Robotics Competition (2018) 
Designed and constructed 16 cm x 16cm maze solving robot 
Wrote the maze solving algorithm (an enhanced version of Trémaux's algorithm where the robot has a built in reference for 
tracking its location) 
Integrated sensors and encoders into the breadboards and interfaced them with my code via library subroutines 
International Aerial Robotics Competition (2019) 
Currently part of a team programming a Parrot Bebop Drone to enable it to interact with a human being and perform certain designated 
tasks (as part of the competition)
