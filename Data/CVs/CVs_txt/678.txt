identify stop trafc sign, red light and green light.
AI/ML FRESHER
My career goals are to develop software and algorithm to relating to one of 
those feld: Artifcial Intelligence, Image Processing, BigData. In order to 
become an AI engineer, I have achieved acceptable skills in programming 
language, machine learning algorithms. As a result, I’m able to bring many 
values that meet the requirements of the customers, which plays an import-
ant role in development of the company.
