Introduction 
Graduated at Mathematics and Computer Science faculty, I have strong 
knowledge about mathematics and algorithm. With my passion about computer 
vision, I make my ideas come true as a competent programmer. I am focusing on 
image processing, pattern recognition and computational challenges.
