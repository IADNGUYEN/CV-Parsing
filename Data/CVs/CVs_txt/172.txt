ABOUT MYSELF
I like to work in group, be a part of a team and speak up my thoughts. I often go to codefight.com to practice my
logic thinking skills and read news on topdev to learn new programming technologies. I know my ability have a lot
of limitations but my dream is not, my truly hobby is not only programming, learning foreign languages is a part of
my hobbies. I am learning Japanese and in the future, I also want to conquer the IELTS.
