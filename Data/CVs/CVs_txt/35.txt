RESEARCH INTEREST 
I	 am	 interested	 in	 Natural	 Language	 Processing	 problems/applications	 such	 as	
Recognizing	 textual	 entailments,	 Information	 Retrieval,	 Questions	 Answering,	
Information	 Extraction,	 Document	 Classification,	 Named	 Entity	 Recognition,	 Shallow	
Discourse	Parsing,	Chatbot.		
I	am	eager	to	apply	and	Machine	learning,	Deep	learning,	Data	Science	to	solve	problems	
in	Natural	Language	Processing	field	and	real-life	problems.	
RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
Below	are	main	researches	which	I	have	conducted:	
Structure	Analysis	in	legal	texts  
Implement	some	conventional	models	(Conditional	Random	Fields)	and	propose	several	
deep	learning-based	models	based	on	Recurrent	Neural	Networks	to	analyze	structures	
of	legal	documents	which	are	written	in	Vietnamese,	Japanese	and	English.  
Develop	Restful	API	and	demonstrated	web-based	applications.	
Legal	Information	Retrieval	and	Textual	Entailment	Recognition	in	legal	
texts  
Develop	 an	 information	 retrieval	 component	 which	 find	 relevant	 articles	 for	 a	 legal	
statement.  
Propose	deep	learning-based	methods	for	recognizing	whether	or	not	a	legal	statement	
is	entailed	from	legal	articles.  
Develop	a	web-based	application	which	can	answer	whether	or	not	a	legal	statement	is	
correct.  
Language:	English  
This	research	is	a	part	of	the	CREST	project	(https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/	)		
Develop	 a	 Question	 Answering	 System	 for	 Company	 Regulatory	
Documents  
Develop	components	for	a	question	answering	system	that	can	answer	questions	related	
to	 company	 regulations	 in	 Japanese:	 data	 processing,	 question	 analysis	 (using	 Deep	
learning),	document	retrieval	(using	Elasticsearch),	candidate	extractions	and	answer	
extractions.  
Develop	a	web-based	application	which	can	retrieve	relevant	documents	and	highlight	
candidate	answers.  
Language:	Japanese  
This	research	is	a	project	between	Nguyen’Lab	and	TIS	company		
(https://www.tis.co.jp/)		
Vietnamese	Named	Entity	Recognition  
Propose	 deep	 learning-based	 models	 for	 Named	 Entity	 Recognitions.	 The	 proposed	
models	allow	incorporating	engineering	features	into	deep	learning	models.  
Models:	Long	Short-Term	memory	(LSTM),	Bidirectional	LSTM,	BiLSTM-CRF	
Shallow	Discourse	Parsing  
Develop	 methods	 that	 can	detect	discourse	 components	in	texts	which	 are	discourse	
connectives	(e.g.	but,	however,	…)	and	arguments.  
Methods:	Conditional	Random	Fields  
Language:	English	
Web-based	health	surveillance	and	text	mining  
Develop	 a	 surveillance	 system	 which	 can	 detect	 unusual	 signs	 of	 user’s	 behavior	 on	
social	networks.	The	system	can	(1)	identify	the	behavior	of	user’s	message	on	social	
network	using	text	classification	techniques	such	as	SVM,	Naïve	Bayes,	Decision	Tree	(2)	
identifying	the	location	(3)	calculating	the	unusual	level	and	(4)	showing	the	result	on	
the	map	(Google	maps)  
Language:	English	
Others	(which	I	am	not	a	primary	person)  
Extract	entities	and	relation	between	proteins	and	entities	in	biomedical	documents  
Building	 a	 Bilingual	 (English-Vietnamese)	 Corpus	 for	 English-Vietnamese	 translation	
task  
Develop	cross	language	information	retrieval	systems
