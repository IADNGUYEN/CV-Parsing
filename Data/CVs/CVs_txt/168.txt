PROJECTS
Iris Recognition
https://github.com/AntiAegis/Iris-Recognition
June 2017 – December 2017
Role: Leader.
Description: I organized a team of 6 members to conduct a research
about Iris recognition algorithms from science articles as a Summer
project.
Target: Two versions of Iris recognition application on Python and
Matlab. Both of them are implemented on Linux.
Language: Python + OpenCV, Matlab.
Event Information Extraction from Flyers
https://github.com/AntiAegis/Event-info-extraction-from-ﬂyers
September 2017 – October 2017
Role: Algorithm development.
Description: This was my project with 2 classmates in the course
"Digital Image Processing". Our work was reading an article from the
Standford university and then realizing it into code.
Target: A Matlab GUI extracting important information of events as
text (e.g. time and location) from poster or ﬂyer images.
Language: Matlab.
Automatic Control via Internet
https://github.com/AntiAegis/Automatic-control-via-Internet
September 2017 – November 2017
Role: System architecture, Networking, Firmware.
Description: This was my project in the course "Embedded System
Design". My team had 4 members and we designed ourselves a Linux
embedded system based on knowledge learned from the course.
Target: A smart home security prototype installed on Raspberry, MCU
TIVAC-1294, and Linux computers.
Language: C, Shell Script.
Forgery Image Detection
My current research and pre-thesis
April 2018 – On going
Role: Leader.
Description: I and my colleague are researching about Deep Learning
approaches in Forgery Image Detection ﬁeld. We read papers of
conventional methods, then link them to modern Deep Learning
models, which we learned from online courses and journal articles.
Target: Deep Learning models solving emerging Forgery Image
Detection problems.
Language: Python + Tensorﬂow.
