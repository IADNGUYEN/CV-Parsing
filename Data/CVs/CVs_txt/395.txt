2017
Research Intern, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany.
Detailed achievements:
Product diversity and Network structure: A minimal model
This was done under the supervision of Prof. Julia Bendul and Prof. Marc-Thorsten H tt.
In this project, I tried to ﬁnd a way to control the synchronization of a speciﬁc type of
manufacturing network while maintaining its performance as well as robustness
The whole project was written in Python, and could be viewed at

2016
Data Analyst, BioTuring Inc., Ho Chi Minh city.
Detailed achievements:
Visualized high-dimensional data into statistical plots, using PCA, t-SNE and other
dimension-reduced algorithms.
Data crawling and data munging
Created and validated models of classic tools that are used in medical research (Kaplan-
Meier Survival plot, Diﬀerent genes expression analyisis)
All the tasks were written in R and Python
Computer skills
Python
Familiar with some machine learning framework, such as:
Tensorﬂow: Most of my projects were done by using this framework.
Keras: I approached Keras recently, through courses in deeplearning.ai.
Some other libraries for data preprocessing and data analysis: Sklearn, Pandas
R
I used ggplot2, CART and some other packages that belong to R-base.

Numer.ai competition
This was a weekly competition, and I played here for some weeks. The method
that I used was Neural network and some other algorithms from sklearn.
