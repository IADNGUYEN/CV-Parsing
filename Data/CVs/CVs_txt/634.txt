SKILLS 
I am the AUT business student with the 
major is Business Design. I've had a good 
amount of experiences in Hospitality and 
Drinks industries and dealing with some 
projects from New Zealand companies such 
as IAG New Zealand and Waitemata DHB 
with my classmates when doing my papers 
in AUT. I chose this major and intend to 
study more about it as I want to get more 
knowledge in social communication and 
customer service.
