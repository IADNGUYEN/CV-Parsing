Projects  
Memory Game  
2D Game Development (JavaScript & CSS) | May 2019  June 2019 
When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down. The player then flips 
over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. If the two tiles have the 
same image, they remain face up. The game has a limit of time, so the score 
is based on how many pairs of cards are matched within that time period. 
Front-End and Back-End Projects | June 2018 – September 2018 
A collection of small projects in Java, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, along 
with a variety of frameworks and databases.
