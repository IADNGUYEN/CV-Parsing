owner. Avoid the trash, spam, trick messages from the estate agents. The trick 
message in estate sites are popular and many house buyers are cheated by the 
estate agents. 
+ Provice the analysis and synthesis data to the site users. Provice many kinds of 
data which the Google and the enemy estate sites do not have. This is different 
features of my site. 
Page 3 
Tool 
: Using tools as below: 
+ Using Stanford NLP core platform (Machine Learning  SPIED and NER  
Java) to detect the real-clearly address, to elinimate the agent messages, to 
generate the new kinds of data which Google does not have. 
+ Using Selenium platform (Java) to collect the ad messages from tenth of the 
estate sites, to collect the news from the daily news sites.  
Responsibilities :
