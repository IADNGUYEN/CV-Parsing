I used GCP instance with Tesla P100 and Tesla K80 GPUs to train my models.
Results: Top 7%  #195/3234  Bronze badge.
Projects
Vietnamese Sentiment Analysis June 2018  June 2018
Skills: tensorﬂow, nlp, lstm, attention mechanism, data crawling and processing
Details: I used FastText pretrained word embedding to embed Vietnamese words.
I built and train dynamic deep bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism
model to classify text.
Realtime Hand-Gestures Recognition June 2018  June 2018
Skills: tensorﬂow, cnn, object detection, ssd, mobilenetv2, aws ec2, transfer learning
