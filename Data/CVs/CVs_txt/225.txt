SUMMARY
A computer vision engineer with hand-on experience in using both traditional and deep learning methods to solve CV
problems. 
SKILLS
Programming language: Python
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Deep Learning: Keras, Pytorch
PROJECTS
Facical Keypoint Detection: An end-to-end pipeline to detect 15 keypoints on human face using Haar cascade (to
detect face) and deep learning (to find keypoints locations). The Kaggle’s “facial keypoint detection challenge” dataset
is used for training and validating the keypoint detector.

Dog Breeds Classification: Solving a fine grain classification task using transfer learning. 
Github repo: https://github.com/NinV/AIND/tree/master/term_2/dog-project
Image captioning: A combination task of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). The method
using in this project is based on the encoder-decoder model often used in machine translation task. The encoder is a
pre-trained RESNET50 to extract feature vectors then feed it to an LSTM network to produce captions.
