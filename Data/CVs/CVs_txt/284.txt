WORK EXPERIENCE 
PERSONAL PROFILE 
Although I am working as embedded engineer at Huu Hong company 
without using Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, when I worked as a teacher 
at Dongan Polytechnic, I have researched AI and applied it to recognize the 
sleeping status of the car driver. This was a topic which I got consolation 
prize from Binh Duong Union of Science and Technology Associations. 
Especially, I also got the third prize from them for Vietnamese recognition 
machine based on AMR Cortex-M4 MCU. The AI really attracted me when I 
graduated from HCM City University of Technology and Education, so doing 
Master’s degree is my clever decision to help me improve the knowledge 
about AI. I read some books during the learning process and did some small 
project by using AI, such as: handwriting recognition, face recognition. Of 
course, to do these tasks, I have must studied a lot of algorithms about digital 
signal processing, image processing. When I was a student, I was an 
excellent member in the robot team. I was charge of programming for 
automatic robot and planning fighting for my team. Besides, I can use quite 
well some programming languages, such as: C/C++, C#, MATLAB.
