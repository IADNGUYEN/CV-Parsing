SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
PROJECT 1:  AUTOMATIC WATERING SYSTEM  2017.
Read the soil moisture value to control the water pump motor with PIC-C compiler  Use sensors to measure soil moisture.  Use PIC microcontroller for data analysis and device control.
Target: automatically control device.
Instructor: Mr. Pham Ngoc Son.
PROJECT 2: SMART FARM WITH ARDUINO MEGA 2018
Build applications to manage and control devices in smart gardens.  Use sensors to collect temperature and humidity values.  Use Blynk to build management application on smartphone.  Set up a connection between Arduino Mega and Esp8266 to process and
transfer data.
Target: Application IoTs  to monitor and control equipment
Instructor: Mr. Phan Van Ca.
FINAL PROJECT: HUMAN FALL DETECT WTH 3D-CNN OR ALGORITHMS ON VIDEO
Analyze human actions to make predictions about falling behavior.  Use 3D-CNN network to train human behavioral identification data.  Analyze the properties of the object in the video to predict human behavior.  compare and evaluate the performance of methods of determining human
behavior.
Use library Keras and Tensorflow backend  of python3 to analyze data. Use Opencv
analyze human body model to pridict fall detection.
Target: Application Machine Learning for analyze behaviours of human.
Instructor: Mrs. Huynh Thi Thu Hien
