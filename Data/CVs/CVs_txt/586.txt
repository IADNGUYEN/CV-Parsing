Personal Project 
Nonparametric methods in Evaluating European Vanilla Options (R, Matlab) : Github | Git.Nonparam  
A project experiments the behavior of simulated stock prices, generated by using Euler discretization scheme, under 
geometric Brownian motion process and stochastic volatility process.  
Two nonparametric methods: Empirical Esscher Transform (EET) and Empirical Characteristic Function (ECF), were 
implemented for evaluation of European vanilla options. And the corresponding numerical results were obtained to 
compare with the results obtained under the closed form formulae of Black-Scholes Merton model and semi-closed 
formulae of Heston model.  
The accuracy of EET and ECF methods were tested using Monte Carlo methods with the absolute percentage errors of 
less than 5% would be accepted.
