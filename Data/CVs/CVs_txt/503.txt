 Bachelor Thesis
Title: Automatic watering system 
Supervisors: Assoc. Prof. Dr. HO PHAM HUY ANH 
Description: The design and implementation of a low-cost system for monitoring and remote
control of a greenhouse using fuzzy logic. For the control system a website was designed to
visualize the main indicators such as nutrient, temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture
and light level...The system was controlled and monitored by the webserver. The webserver
was programmed with a fuzzy algorithm by Node-RED to monitor and perform control actions
for soil moisture and nutrient.  For connectivity to the webpage, an ESP8266 Wemos  was
used and the local area network was established with Lora wireless technology for data
transmission. Thus, it was possible to establish a local area network, monitor and control the 
greenhouse climate variables manually or automatically. The application designed allowed
access to the configuration, monitoring, and control of climatic conditions in the greenhouse.
Thus, the use of resources for a gable roof greenhouse prototype was optimized.
