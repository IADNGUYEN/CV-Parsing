BRIEF INFORMATION 
I’m still a student,learning at the faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. 
EXPERIENCE 
I known programming in C and Python. 
Learn and use raspberry pi but I’m still a newbie in this area, and use linux to do some 
simple tasks. 
I have code Data structure and Algorithms  
I have use git command (git clone, git add, git push), use git for read and reasearch 
Know use Linux for program and use Python in linux 
Know a little bit about  Linear regression, Logictis regresion ,Neural Network, Deep 
Learning, Gradient Descent 
Know how to use basic Pandas to analyse datasets 
I use scikit learn to do some simple examples and now I’m learning simple 
Tensorflow, Keras with Python, Build Machine learning algorthrim linear 
regression, Logictic Regresion, Gradient Descent and know a little bit about CNN 
PROJECTS 
Facial Keypoints Detection  This is actually a simple competition on Kaggle.com which aims to automatically detect 
where is the keypoints of face images. This can be used as a building block in several 
application like: 
+ Tracking faces in images and video 
+ Analyse face expression 
+ Biometrics/ face recognition  I have learn how to use pandas to load and transform dataset from Kaggle to memory 
since everything is provided by files csv   
Build a simple neural networks with 3 Dense layers and use some techniques to 
improve result quality and improve training performance like applying Dropout layers, 
using ELU activation instead of Relu to prevent overfiting  Know how to load and save automatically a model after finishing training  Apply some simple method to save features after finishing step ‘feature extraction’ 
since it takes a lot of time to do, one of my favorite solution I have used in this project is 
using python’s pickle  Using matplotlib to render the result of my neural network after training since I would 
like to verify with the real picture from myself
