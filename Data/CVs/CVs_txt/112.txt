Description 
In this project, a Sales Management System  was requested by South Asia 
Information Technology in order to help the  company solve their  sales and 
warehouse operations issues. 
As our customer company has a substantial distributors network all over the country, 
the new system  helps them to centralize business data in one single system. As the 
results, distributors can flexibly and accurately  manage delivery to customers.  
When customer places a sales order, the sales staff of a distributor can check for 
their stock availability in the system, including reserved items. In case their  stock is 
not enough, they can view other distributor’s stock information and request for the 
transfer of stock from other distributors or request the company central office to  buy 
items from suppliers to meet the customer’s demands. 
The system can manage hundreds of transactions daily. The system can also control 
user access rights at detail data level. 
As  System Analyst,  Designer and Coder,  I have involved in  project stages from  
analysis, design, development and deployment.
