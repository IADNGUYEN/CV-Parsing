Development of a High Power Dielectric Antenna for Delivery of Picosecond Pulses

A Dual Resonant Transformer and a Dielectric Antenna for Picosecond Pulse Radiation 
This thesis discusses the development of a pulsed power system for high power picosecond 
pulse radiation. In the system, a charging transformer, which generates a high voltage pulse of ~100 
kV, can be used for charging a transmission line in less than 100 ns. Such a short pulse could cause 
a peak gap switch to break down and generate a picosecond pulse transient for radiation. A 
dielectric antenna, if fed with the high voltage picosecond pulses, can radiate them to targets made 
of high dielectric materials. Biological tissues, for instance, can be targeted for electrostimulation. 
The transformer was designed considering the needs to deliver a high gain and fast output. 
We showed that a transformer in the dual resonant mode, in which the resonance of the primary and 
the second is equal, can produce a voltage gain of approximately 6. The output voltage of the 
transformer is more than 100kV with an input of 15kV. This shows the average gain of the 
transformer is 7. The fast output requires the voltage at the secondary winding needs to be less than 
100 ns in order for achieving a picosecond transient in the oil peak switch. This was done by low-
inductance windings with an air core. Two winding configurations were explored: a cylindrical 
winding and a toroidal winding. The cylindrical winding appears to be a better option in terms of 
the gain. Experimental results show that for a capacitive load (30pF), the voltage can be charged up 
to 33 kV in 20 ns. 
A conical dielectric antenna was investigated through simulation and experiments. The 
antenna is made of a V-shape transmission line on a ceramic conical body with dielectric constant 
of 28. This antenna was immersed in transformer oil for high voltage insulation, which allowed for 
the feed voltage to be as high as 50 kV. The antenna was characterized by an electric field sensor 
immersed in water. We found that the emitted field increases as the voltage increases, but it reaches 
a saturation for 40 kV. The highest electric field is 1.5 kV/cm even for the input voltage 50 kV. This 
is 6 times less than simulation. We speculate that the discrepancy is caused by the dielectric tangent 
loss, which was not taken into account in the simulation.  
Future work towards a complete system includes a choice of a linear dielectric material 
which is capable of sustaining its dielectric constant for a high electric field and the study of an oil 
peak switch, which is a critical component between the transformer and the antenna.
