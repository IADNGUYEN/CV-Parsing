Projects 
OIL SPILL DETECTION AND FORECASTING USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES – THESIS | 
2016-2017 
A data-driven failure analysis employing machine learning technique to forecast partial or 
complete failures of the oil system. Oil and gas data are collected from several sources to train 
a predictive model using Sequential minimal optimizer (SMO) algorithm which classifies 
failure and normal events. The SMO model is optimized and enhanced to minimize the 
uncertainty of the predictions. 
IBEAM PROJECT FOR BLUE SNOW ENERGY CO-OPERATION | 2015-2016 
Use Machine Learning algorithm to design the application for cooling air-cond system of the 
building. The system uses MVC architecture design with the implementation of server and 
client (Android app) side using Jetty and Jersey API for RESTful communication.
