dhali. yucheng zhang, a dual resonant transformer andadielectric antenna for picosecond pulse radiation, this thesis discusses the development ofapulsed power system for high power picosecond, pulse radiation. in the systemacharging transformer  which generatesahigh voltage pulse of ~100, kv  can be used for chargingatransmission line in less than 100 ns. suchashort pulse could cause, a peak gap switch to break down and generateapicosecond pulse transient for radiation. a, dielectric antenna  if fed with the high voltage picosecond pulses  can radiate them to targets made, of high dielectric materials. biological tissues  for instance  can be targeted for electrostimulation., the transformer was designed considering the needs to deliverahigh gain and fast output., we showed thatatransformer in the dual resonant mode  in which the resonance of the primary and, the second is equal  can produceavoltage gain of approximately 6. the output voltage of the, transformer is more than 100kv with an input of 15kv. this shows the average gain of the, transformer is 7. the fast output requires the voltage at the secondary winding needs to be less than, 100 ns in order for achievingapicosecond transient in the oil peak switch. this was done by low , inductance windings with an air core. two winding configurations were exploredacylindrical, winding andatoroidal winding. the cylindrical winding appears to beabetter option in terms of, the gain. experimental results show that foracapacitive load 30pf  the voltage can be charged up, to 33 kv in 20 ns., a conical dielectric antenna was investigated through simulation and experiments. the, antenna is made ofav shape transmission line onaceramic conical body with dielectric constant, of 28. this antenna was immersed in transformer oil for high voltage insulation  which allowed for, the feed voltage to be as high as 50 kv. the antenna was characterized by an electric field sensor, immersed in water. we found that the emitted field increases as the voltage increases  but it reaches, a saturation for 40 kv. the highest electric field is 1.5 kv cm even for the input voltage 50 kv. this, is6times less than simulation. we speculate that the discrepancy is caused by the dielectric tangent, loss  which was not taken into account in the simulation., future work towardsacomplete system includesachoice ofalinear dielectric material, which is capable of sustaining its dielectric constant forahigh electric field and the study of an oil, peak switch  which isacritical component between the transformer and the antenna.",,"research interests, electromagnetic applications  antenna theories and applications  transformer designs and, teaching interests, head of r&d department at 6m insulation company
